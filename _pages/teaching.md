* **[COMP6741 Algorithms for Intractable problems](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP6741)**  
I designed [COMP6741](https://serggasp.github.io/comp6741/), which was first offered in 2014s2 under the name "Parameterized and Exact Computation".
After a major redesign in 2022, the name is now "Algorithms for Intractable Problems" and its scope is broadened to most contemporary algorithmic techniques to tackle intractable problems.
I have taught the course in
2014s2, 2015s2, 2016s2, 2017s2, 2018s2, 2019t3, 2020t3, 2022t2, and 2023t1.

* **[COMP3121 / 9101 Algorithms & Programming Techniques](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP3121)**  
I guest lectured on computational intractability / NP-hardness in 2014s1 and 2016s1.
I was an online forum tutor in 2020t2.
In 2023t3, I am lecturer-in-charge and teach 1/3 of the course.

* **[ENGG3600 Engineering Vertically Integrated Project](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/ENGG3600)**  
I was the academic lead for the project GraphAbility on the implementation of open-source graph algorithms in 2021.

* **[ENGG3060: 2020 Maker Games](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2020/ENGG3060)**  
I was the academic mentor for 2 projects in collaboration with Accenture and Pollinate in 2020t2 and 2020t3.

* **[COMP4121 Advanced and Parallel Algorithms](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2024/COMP4121/)**  
I guest lectured on preprocessing / kernelization in 2013s2.

## tu wien
At TU Wien, I co-taught 184.684 Discrete Reasoning Methods in 2012S and 184.708 Seminar in Complexity Theory in 2011W.

## u chile
At Universidad de Chile, I guest lectured on parameterized complexity in CC61X Design and Analysis of Adaptive Algorithms in 2010.

## u bergen
At Universitetet i Bergen, I taught satisfiability algorithms (2006), and permutation and circle graphs (2007) in INF339 Selected topics in Algorithms and Complexity.
Moreover, I performed a trial lecture on Data Streaming as a requirement for the PhD program.
