My research and research interests mainly fall under the following topics.
* **[Algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_algorithms) and [Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity)**: exponential time algorithms, parameterized complexity, quantum algorithms, combinatorial optimization
* **[Combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics)**: extremal combinatorics, graph classes, graph decompositions
* **[Satisfiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem) and [Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem)**: backdoors, (local) consistency, global constraints, propagation
* **Applications**: algorithmic game theory, computational social choice, preprocessing, resource allocation, scheduling
