My [research](/research/) is about the study of intractable computational problems. I design new algorithms for these NP-hard problems, analyse their running time, and make fine-grained complexity classifications. I am interested in deterministic, randomized, and quantum algorithms. I consider simple-to-state, fundamental computational problems with applications in diverse areas and I have mainly looked at problems from Boolean satisfiability and constraint satisfaction, networks and graphs, and algorithmic decision theory. 

I am affiliated with the following entities at UNSW Sydney (The University of New South Wales):
* [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering),
* [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering),
* [Algorithms group](https://algo-unsw.github.io) (head of group).
* [Algorithmic Decision Theory group](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~adt/), and
* [UNSW AI Institute](https://www.unsw.edu.au/unsw-ai).

I serve on the editorial board of [Acta Informatica](https://www.springer.com/journal/236).
