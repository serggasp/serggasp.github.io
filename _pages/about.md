My [research](/research/) is mainly about the study of intractable computational problems. I design new algorithms for these NP-hard problems, analyse their running time, and make fine-grained complexity classifications. I am interested in deterministic, randomized, and quantum algorithms. The considered computational problems have applications in many different areas and I have mainly looked at problems from Boolean satisfiability and constraint satisfaction, networks and graphs, and algorithmic decision theory. 

I am affiliated with the following entities at UNSW Sydney (The University of New South Wales):
* [Faculty of Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering),
* [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering),
* [Algorithms group](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering/our-research/research-groups/algorithms) (head of group).
* [Algorithmic Decision Theory group](https://www.unsw.edu.au/engineering/our-schools/computer-science-and-engineering/our-research/research-groups/algorithmic-decision-theory), and
* [UNSW AI Institute](https://www.unsw.edu.au/unsw-ai).

I serve on the editorial boards of [Algorithms](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/algorithms) and [Acta Informatica](https://www.springer.com/journal/236).
