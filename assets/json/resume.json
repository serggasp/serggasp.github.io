Before I could take up the postdoctoral fellowship, I was awarded a DECRA (Discovery Early Career Award) by the Australian Research Council (ARC), which was followed up by a Future Fellowship. After 3 successful rounds of promotion, I became a professor in 2022. Since 2018 I have also been the Associate Head of School (Research).","highlights":["DECRA","Future Fellowship","Discovery Project 2015 & 2021","head of Algorithms group","collaborative research projects with NICTA and Data61"]},{"name":"TU Wien","position":"postdoctoral researcher","url":"https://www.tuwien.at/en/","startDate":"2010-10-01","endDate":"2012-05-31","summary":"Funded by Stefan Szeider's ERC starting grant."},{"name":"Universidad de Chile","position":"postdoctoral researcher","url":"https://uchile.cl/","startDate":"2009-09-25","endDate":"2010-09-24","summary":"Funded by the Centro de Modelamiento Matemático."},{"name":"Université de Montpellier","position":"postdoctoral researcher","url":"http://www.umontpellier.fr/","startDate":"2009-01-01","endDate":"2010-08-31","summary":"Funded by an ANR project on graph decompositions and algorithms (joint between LaBRI, LIAFA, and LIRMM)."}],"volunteer":[],"education":[{"institution":"Universitetet i Bergen, Bergen, Norway","url":"https://www.uib.no/","area":"computer science","studyType":"PhD","startDate":"2006-01-01","endDate":"2008-12-31","score":"","courses":["Algorithms","PhD thesis 2008 'Exponential Time Algorithms: Structures, Measures, and Bounds' supervised by Fedor V.
